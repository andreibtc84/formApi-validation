# Create a User Registration form.

Hosted at: https://andreibtc84.github.io/formApi-validation/

It should have an Email field and a password field. When the user submits the form, create the user (i.e. https://reqres.in/api/users). Display an error message if the request fails.

# Stretch: Add form validation

Add frontend validation to your form before you submit it:

## Password:

- must have at least 8 characters
- must have at least one uppercase letter, lowercase letter, number, and a special character (i.e. @!£$%^&\*()\_+€#-?/[]{};:'",.<>~)
- Email must be an email address
- If the form fails validation, do not submit it to the creation endpoint, and show an error to the user.
- Streched to provide the user with info on success with returned data from the API. + some styling
